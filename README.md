# Password Checker Tool

Checks if passwords have been compromised using the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) API ‚Äî and reports exactly how many times each password has been breached.

> üîí Never enter real passwords into untrusted tools ‚Äî this tool is for educational purposes only.

## How It Works

Reads all content from `passwords.txt`, splitting passwords by single spaces (`' '`) only. Sends each password (hashed) to the Have I Been Pwned API. For each password, retrieves the exact number of times it appeared in known data breaches. Reports whether the password was found ‚Äî and how many times.

Example output:
congratulations!! uendoe has not been pawned
totototo has been pawned 27868 times

Important: Passwords must be separated by a single space character only. Newlines, commas, tabs, or multiple consecutive spaces are not supported ‚Äî they will cause errors or incorrect parsing.

## How to Use

Install Python (if not installed): https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install the requests library:
py -m pip install requests

Create a file named `passwords.txt` in the same folder as `checkmypass.py`.

Format the file with passwords separated by single spaces only:
password123 totototo mammama keeeke

Do NOT use commas, newlines, or multiple spaces.

Run the script:
py checkmypass.py

You‚Äôll see output like:
congratulations!! #bendoe has not been pawned
totototo has been pawned 27868 times
mammama has been pawned 332 times
keeeke has been pawned 1 times

Interpretation:
- "has not been pawned" means the password was not found in any breach.
- "has been pawned X times" means it was found in X known data leaks. Even one time means it‚Äôs compromised.

Pro Tip: Change any password found in a breach ‚Äî even once.

## Security Note

This tool uses k-anonymity via the HIBP API ‚Äî your full password is never sent. Only the first 5 characters of its SHA-1 hash are transmitted.
